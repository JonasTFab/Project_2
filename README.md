# Project 2: Eigenvalue problem

In this project we wanted to code in C++ for the first time. It has been a lot of educational experience when it comes to understanding a new programming language and will probably use it more in the future.

The C++ code file can be found in the folder named eigen_value_problems named main.cpp. We have now reduced the number of several codes to just one in unlike what we did in project 1. The code includes solving the eigenvalue problem for both an TÃ¶plitz matrix and also a tridiagonal matrix where the diagonal elements are changing.

By unslashing line 309 in the code, you will run the code that solves the
